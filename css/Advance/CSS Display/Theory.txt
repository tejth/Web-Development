THE IMPORTANT THING TO NOTE IS YOU CANT CHANGE THE HEIGHT AND WIDTH 
OF INLINE ELEMENTS. THEY ARE DEFAULT TO SIZE OF THEIR CONTENT.
eg... img,span,a etc...


Block elements and INLINE Block elements can change in HEIGHT and WIDTH.
eg..h1,p,forms  etc....

THE NONE PROPERTY MAKES THE ELEMENT DISAPPEAR.
